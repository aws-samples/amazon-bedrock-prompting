If you write them down, you can forget them because they’re in there. Don’t just go to the diary or the journal to write down when you’re frustrated and confused. Go to the journal to write down what you’re doing in life when you’re rolling, when you’re catching green lights, when you’re in the flow, because we will get out of flow again.

And I was asking myself the original question and trying to answer it, how and where and what can I do to be most useful to myself, to my family and to the most amount of people. The embassy, the category of politics came up and it’s a privileged one that I gave great consideration to. But at this point in my life are the things I’ve got a 13 year old, 11 year old and an eight year old, the life I’m living right now, the storytelling I want to keep doing, it’s not the category for me at this point in my life.\n",

A lot of people were out of school. A lot of people needed some help because they didn’t know how to deal with it. And so we, my foundation, which is the Just Keep Livin Foundations, we got together and said, we’re not disaster relief, but want to be disaster relief. We said, let’s go. And I headed to Texas. I got on the phone, Camilla got on the phone. 100% of the people we called, whether it was companies who donated, whether it was musicians who came in, everybody was a yes in the first 30 seconds. We went down to Texas, put the show on. We raised over $7.7 million, which is still being put out to our community.\n",

Disaster relief, you have to move quickly because if you take your time to say, oh, this has got to be perfect. Something else is taking the front page news. There’s another disaster coming, you know? So you need to jump on it quickly and get everyone together and take advantage of trying to get people to give at that time when it is front page news and they know people need help.\n",
