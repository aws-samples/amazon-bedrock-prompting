      "A study analyzed 29 patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) at a hospital in India. The majority (76%) were female. About 40% of females were identified at birth due to genital ambiguity. However, some females sought treatment only in adulthood due to virilization. Nearly all males presented as infants with adrenal crisis. Patients commonly had short stature (35%) and were treated with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone. About 1/3 had over-suppressed hormone levels, potentially impacting height. Adult height was below average for classic CAH patients at 142cm for females and 157cm for non-classic CAH. The study highlights the need for early diagnosis and optimized treatment of CAH.    \n",

      "A genetic disorder that results in abnormalities in the biosynthesis of steroid precursors is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH). The clinical range varies from the mild, non-classical kind to the severe, classical kind, and is brought on by an enzyme shortage. 29 people were enrolled in the research, including 22 women and 7 men. 11 of them were adults, and 18 of them were children. While 9 infants were discovered at birth owing to genital ambiguity, 1 presented with adrenal crisis symptoms at four weeks of age, 4 patients presented in the pre-pubertal period due to early adrenarche, 5 patients presented in the late adolescent period with marked virilization, and 3 patients presented in the late adolescent period with features of polycystic ovarian disease, 22 women were identified as having classic cah. The mean adult height of those with nccah was higher than that of those with classic cah, although none of the nccah patients received glucocorticoids and all children were given hydrocortisone. Three of the adult patients who sought medical attention late were given pubertal induction with ethinyl estradiol. \n",
